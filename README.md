## Quadrotor Control, Path Planning, Trajectory generation in static Indoor Enviorenments

As a part of the MEAM 620 Advanced Robotics Course, Matlab code for the following was written
- PD Controller 
- A\* and Dijstra and Path planning Algorithms 
- Minimum acceleration Trajectory optimisation 

## PD Controller

- Change trajectories in Controller/runsim.m to circle or diamond or x\_motion
- Please refer [modelling_quadrotor_dynamics.pdf](modelling_quadrotor_dynamics.pdf) to model the controller of the quadrotor
- Vizualisations [Desired (blue) and Actual (red)]

### Some Results

- Spiral                                           -Circle
